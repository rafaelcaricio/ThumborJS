# ThumborJS

Thumbor Javascript (ThumborJS) is a library to generate encrypted [Thumbor](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/) URLs. 

## Usage

Using ThumborJS is pretty simple, all you have to do is create a CryptoURL instance with the 
proper key and original image URL and start customizing it.

```javascript
CryptoURL crypto = new CryptoURL('my-security-key', 'http://my.server.com/path/to/my/image.jpg');
var encryptedURL = crypto.resize(300, 200).withSmartCropping().toString();
console.log(encrypedURL);
// /LFS8rnXScOTlQvOJBE8i55p_LwzRr7aEgLYtDBpyAwUTwd2x1TsZr6yOHZpBF_YF/my.server.com/some/path/to/image.jpg
```

## Development

You need to install [ezcrypto](https://github.com/ElmerZhang/ezcrypto) and [VowsJS](http://vowsjs.org/). Just run:

```bash
$ npm install ezcrypto vows
```

Then you can run all tests.

```bash
$ make vows
```
